def: "The selective, non-covalent, often stoichiometric, interaction of a molecule with one or more specific sites on another molecule." [GOC:ceb, GOC:mah, ISBN:0198506732 "Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"]
comment: For ligands that bind to signal transducing receptors, consider the molecular function term 'receptor binding ; GO:0005102' and its children.
